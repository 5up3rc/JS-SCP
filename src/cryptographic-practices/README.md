Cryptographic Practices
=======================

Let's make the first statement as strong as your cryptography should be:
**hashing and encrypting are two different things**.

There's a general misconception and most of the time hashing and encrypting are
used interchangeably, incorrectly. They are different concepts and they also
serve different purposes.

## Hashing

A hash is a string or number generated by a (hash) function from source data

```
hash = F(data)
```

The hash has fixed length and its value vary widely with small variations in
input (collisions may still happen). A good hashing algorithm won't allow to
turn a hash into its original source[^1]. MD5 is the most popular hashing
algorithm but security wise BLAKE2 is considered the strongest and most
flexible.
However, BLAKE2 has very little support in Node.js, but for demonstration
purposes we will se the `blakejs` package. If for any reason we cannot use it,
then we fallback to SHA-256.

Example using `blakejs`

```javascript
const blake = require('blakejs');

console.log(blake.blake2bHex('JS - Secure Coding Practices'));
// prints 0b72e001aa51f2f0ae9c7aca563596551bb8f1b3cbb48b5be509e998e71587152eaa62db361f5060f03a96a713588d60c164654659bb5993a5908b187646e063

console.log(blake.blake2sHex('JS - Secure Coding Practices'));
// prints bd3eb89e82ccfb45677b507aec93b5262768c879a60d2f158bf25a11d7fab07f
```

The [blakejs package and it's documentation is available here][4].

Example of `SHA256` hashing using Node.js's `crypto` library:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');
const pass = "SecretPassword";

const hash = crypto.createHash('sha256').update(pass).digest('base64');

console.log(hash);
//Result: 1LyW5Lkjdw11Aeifiajm5Nh7th8dKnk53ncqd6IhpNs=
```

So remeber, when you have something that you don't need to know what it is, only
if it is what it is supposed to be (like checking file integrity after
download), you should use hashing[^2]

## Encryption

On the other hand, encryption turns data into variable length data using a key

```
encrypted_data = F(data, key)
```

Unlike the hash, we can compute `data` back from `encrypted_data` applying the
right decryption function and key

```
data = F⁻¹(encrypted_data, key)
```

Encryption should be used whenever you need to communicate or store sensitive
data, which you or someone else needs to access later on for further processing.
A "simple" encryption use case is the HTTPS - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
Secure.  

AES is the _de facto_ standard when it comes to symmetric key encryption. This
algorithm, as many other symmetric ciphers, can be implemented in different
modes.  

You'll notice in the code sample below, GCM (Galois Counter Mode) was used,
instead of the more popular (in cryptography code examples, at least) CBC/ECB.
The main difference between GCM and CBC/ECB is the fact that the former is an
**authenticated** cipher mode, meaning that after the encryption stage, an
authentication tag is added to the ciphertext, which will then be validated
**prior** to message decryption, ensuring the message has not been tampered
with.

The code sample of `AES-256-GCM` encryption and decryption using the `crypto`
module:

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

// generate a new IV for each encryption
const iv = crypto.randomBytes(12)M

// Generate salt
const salt = crypto.randomBytes(64);

// The masterkey - Example only!
const masterkey = "09Kssa22daVsF2jSV5brIHu1545Kjs82";

encrypt (text) => {
  // Create the cipher
  const cipher = crypto.createCipheriv('aes-256-gcm', masterkey, iv);

  // Encrypt the plaintext
  const encrypted = cipher.update(text, 'utf8', 'hex');

  // We are done writing data
  encrypted += cipher.final('hex');

  // Get authentication tag (GCM)
  const tag = cipher.getAuthTag();

  return {
    content: encrypted,
    tag: tag
  };
}

decrypt (encrypted) => {
  // Initialize deciphering
  const decipher = crypto.createDecipheriv('aes-256-gcm', masterkey, iv);

  // Set our authentication tag
  decipher.setAuthTag(encrypted.tag);

  // Update ciphertext content
  let dec = decipher.update(encrypted.content, 'hex', 'utf8');

  // Finalize writing of data and set encoding
  dec += decipher.final('utf8');

  // Return plaintext
  return dec;
}

let result = encrypt("JS - Secure Coding Practices");
console.log(result);
// encrypted: b08fc897face59992f901acf0dc21c745640fe9989bf988318d15145

result = decrypt(result);
console.log(result);
// decrypted: JS - Secure Coding Practices
```

There are also modules for this purpose. One of the most popular is `node-forge`
and for completeness we will also show how an example using it. Note that
`node-forge` consists of a native implementation of the TLS protocol, a set of
cryptographic utilities, and a set of tools for developing web apps that require
many network resources.

Let's see how the `aes-256-cbc` encryption/decryption can be achieved using
`node-forge`:

## Encryption

```javascript
const forge = requires('node-forge');

// generate a random key and IV
// Note: a key size of 16 bytes will use AES-128, 24 => AES-192, 32 => AES-256
const key = forge.random.getBytesSync(16);
const iv = forge.random.getBytesSync(16);

// encrypt some bytes using GCM mode
const cipher = forge.cipher.createCipher('AES-GCM', key);
cipher.start({
  iv: iv, // should be a 12-byte binary-encoded string or byte buffer
  additionalData: 'binary-encoded string', // optional
  tagLength: 128 // optional, defaults to 128 bits
});
cipher.update(forge.util.createBuffer(someBytes));
cipher.finish();

const encrypted = cipher.output;
const tag = cipher.mode.tag;

// outputs encrypted hex
console.log(encrypted.toHex());

// outputs authentication tag
console.log(tag.toHex());

// Continues below
```

## Decryption

```javascript
// Continuation of the previous snippet

// decrypt some bytes using GCM mode
const decipher = forge.cipher.createDecipher('AES-GCM', key);
decipher.start({
  iv: iv,
  additionalData: 'binary-encoded string', // optional
  tagLength: 128, // optional, defaults to 128 bits
  tag: tag // authentication tag from encryption
});
decipher.update(encrypted);

const pass = decipher.finish();

// pass is false if there was a failure (eg: authentication tag didn't match)
if(pass) {
  // outputs decrypted hex
  console.log(decipher.output.toHex());
}
```

On the other hand, you have Public key cryptography or asymmetric cryptography
which makes use of pairs of keys: public and private. Public key cryptography
is less _performant_ than symmetric key cryptography for most cases, so its most
common use-case is sharing a symmetric key between two parties using asymmetric
cryptography, so they can then use the symmetric key to exchange messages
encrypted with symmetric cryptography.

Aside from `AES`, which is 90's technology, supports more modern symmetric
encryption algorithms which also provide authentication, such as
`chacha20poly1305`.

Another interesting package in Node.js is `sodium`. This is a reference to
Dr. Daniel J. Bernstein's NaCl library, which is a very popular modern
cryptography library.
It's essentially a port of the Libsodium encryption library to Node.js.
The `sodium` package is comprised of implementations of NaCl's
abstractions for sending encrypted messages for the two most common use-cases:

* Sending authenticated, encrypted messages between two parties using public key
  cryptography.
* Sending authenticated, encrypted messages between two parties using symmetric
  (_aka_ secret-key) cryptography.

It is very advisable to use one of these abstractions instead of direct use of
AES, if they fit your use-case.

It's also important to node that at the time of writing, the `sodium` library
has no implementation of memory allocation functions.

Please note you should "_establish and utilize a policy and process for how
cryptographic keys will be managed_", protecting "_master secrets from
unauthorized access_". That being said: your cryptographic keys shouldn't be
hardcoded in the source code (as it is on this example).

[Node.js's crypto package][1] collects common cryptographic constants, and
supports all cipher suits that are part of `OpenSSL` as stated in the
documentation:  

> The algorithm is dependent on `OpenSSL`, examples are `aes192`, etc. On recent
> `OpenSSL` releases, `openssl list-cipher-algorithms` will display the
> available cipher algorithms.
