Pseudo-Random Generators
========================

In OWASP Secure Coding Practices you'll find what seems to be a really complex
guideline: "_All random numbers, random file names, random GUIDs, and random
strings should be generated using the cryptographic moduleâ€™s approved random
number generator when these random values are intended to be un-guessable_", so
let's talk about "random numbers".

Cryptography relies on some randomness, but for the sake of correctness what
most programming languages provide out-of-the-box is a pseudo-random number
generator: [JavaScript's Math.random()][1] is not an exception.

An example of pseudo-random number generation using `Math.random()`:

```javascript
getRandomArbitrary (min, max) => {
  const _min = Math.ceil(min);
  const _max = Math.floor(max);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (_max - _min) + _min);
}

const max = 1000
const min = 0

console.log(getRandomArbitrary(min,max))
```

Because [Math.random()][1] is a pseudo-random number generator they use a Seed,
like many others.
This Seed is **solely** responsible for the randomness of the pseudo-random
number generator -- if it is known or predictable, the same will happen to
generated number sequence.

You should carefully read the documentation when it states that:

> `Math.random()` does not provide cryptographically secure random numbers. Do
> not use them for anything related to security. Use the `Web Crypto API`
> instead, and more precisely the `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` method.

In Node.js we can use the `crypto.randomBytes` to generate pseudo-random
numbers. But this requires some precautions, namely, the direct usage of it.

So why does the direct usage can lead to problems? Due to a possible "bias" in
random value generation.
A great article with additional information has been written by user joepie91
on github.com and can be found [here][2].

So how can we generate a cryptographically secure random values? There are two
ways we can approach this problem, each more suited for a specific purpose.

First, using the UUID version 4. UUID stands for `Universally unique
identifiers` and consists of a 128 bit number.

In Node.js there are several packages that can be used to generate a UUID. The
most popular is `uuid` and can be found [here][3].

The package is very easy to use, as shown in the sample below:

```javascript
const uuid = require('uuid/v4');
const uuid1 = uuid();

console.log(uuid1);
// Result: a61903ff-bb29-4846-849d-0da018892da4
```

Another option is to generate cryptographically secure value using the `crypto`
module. In this module there's a method called `randomBytes` that returns a
buffer with randomly generated values.

Looking at the documentation we can see we need some parameters being passed
along to generate our random value: 

```
crypto.randomBytes(size[, callback])
```

So let's look at example of it's usage. Taken from the documentation:  

```javascript
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Generate a 256 byte random value
crypto.randomBytes(64, (err, buf) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(buf.toString('hex'));
  // result: 87273bd2e76021481ddb3a0aa562c182149015d91edff850b41a98b67ba77b49c87c6c32bc756fe24865d7398629fc52358e2b871163b217d8bddee5707a6043
})
```

Note that although in the example we chose the encoding to be `hex` it could
also be `base64`, `ascii`, `utf-8`, `utf16le`/`ucs2` or `binary`.

You may notice that running [crypto.randomBytes][4] is slower than
[Math.random][1] but this is expected: the fastest algorithm isn't always the
safest. Crypto's `randomBytes` is also safer to implement; an example of
this, is the fact that you *CANNOT* seed crypto/rand, the library uses
OS-randomness for this, preventing developer misuse.

If you're curious about how using `Math.random` can lead to problems, a great
article has been written about a problem in Chrome's V8 Engine related to it's
use. You can read it [here][5].

So remember, if randomness is crucial (like in cryptography or token
generation), then don't use `Math.random()`. Instead, use
`crypto.randomBytes()`.

Finally, it's important to establish and use a policy and process for
cryptographic key management. For example, a specialist is in charge of the key
generation and management, as well as responsible for deploying them to
production servers. So, if possible, consider a central key management system
with distributed execution.
