## Hazardous Characters

Any character or encoded representation of a character that can effect the
intended operation of the application or associated system by being interpreted
to have a special meaning, outside the intended use of the character. These
characters may be used to:

* Altering the structure of existing code or statements
* Inserting new unintended code
* Altering paths
* Causing unexpected outcomes from program functions or routines
* Causing error conditions
* Having any of the above effects on down stream applications or systems

## Regular Expression

A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. ([source][1])

## ReDoS

Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack,
that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach
extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related
to input size).

## dot-dot-slash

Path alteration characters like `../` and `..\`

## Sanitization

Sanitization refers to the process of removing or replacing submitted data to
ensure that it is valid and safe.

## Canonicalize

To reduce various encodings and representations of data to a single simple form.

## CDN

Content Delivery Network or Content Distribution Network is a geographically
distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to
distribute service spatially relative to end-users to provide high availability
and high performance. ([source][cdn])

## SRI

Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature that enables browsers to verify that files they fetch (for example, from a CDN) are delivered without unexpected manipulation. It works by allowing you to provide a cryptographic hash that a fetched file must match. ([source][sri])

## CSP 

Content Security Policy is a computer security standard introduced to prevent
cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking and other code injection attacks
resulting from execution of malicious content in the trusted web page context.
