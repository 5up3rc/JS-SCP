## Hazardous Characters

Any character or encoded representation of a character that can effect the
intended operation of the application or associated system by being interpreted
to have a special meaning, outside the intended use of the character. These
characters may be used to:

* Altering the structure of existing code or statements
* Inserting new unintended code
* Altering paths
* Causing unexpected outcomes from program functions or routines
* Causing error conditions
* Having any of the above effects on down stream applications or systems

## Regular Expression

A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for
describing a search pattern. ([source][1])

## ReDoS

Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack,
that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach
extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related
to input size).

## dot-dot-slash

Path alteration characters like `../` and `..\`

## Sanitization

Sanitization refers to the process of removing or replacing submitted data to
ensure that it is valid and safe.

## Canonicalize

To reduce various encodings and representations of data to a single simple form.

## XSS 

Cross-Site Scripting is an attack that consists in injecting malicious
JavaScript code in the website.

## DOM

Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent
application programming interface that treats an HTML, XHTML, or XML document as
a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the
document. ([source][dom])

## URI

Unified Resource Identifier

## JSON

JavaScript Object Notation is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is
easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and
generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language,
Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is
completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to
programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java,
JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal
data-interchange language. ([source][json])
