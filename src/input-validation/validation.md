Validation
==========

In validation checks, the user input is checked against a set of conditions in
order to guarantee that the user is indeed entering the expected data.

**IMPORTANT:** If the validation fails, the input must be rejected.

This is important not only from a security standpoint but from the perpective
of data consistency and integrity, since data is usually used across a variety
of systems and applications.

This article lists the security risks developers should be aware of when
developing web applications in JavaScript.
