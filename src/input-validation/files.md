# File Manipulation

Any time file usage is required ( `read` or `write` a file ), validation checks
should also be performed, since most of the file manipulation operations deal
with user data.

Other file check procedures include "File existence check", to verify that a
filename exists.

Addition file information is in the [File Management][2] section and information
regarding `Error Handling` can be found in the [Error Handling][3] section of
the document.
