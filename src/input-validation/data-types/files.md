    # File Manipulation

User input data can also take the form of uploaded files which should be
subject of strict validation.

[Express web framework for Node][1] recommends [multer middleware][2] for
handling `multipart/form-data`.
In this section we will cover the most important security best practices
regarding files uploads, pointing you to the middleware documentation page
which if full of usage examples.

## Store uploaded files on a specific location

Uploaded files should be stored on a specific destination other than the
location from where your application is running.

Files should be stored without execution privileges and directory listing
should be disabled.

Regarding storage location, [multer midlleware][2] supports two types:
[DiskStorage][3] and [MemoryStorage][4]. Remember to specify which you want to
use as the default one is `MemoryStorage` which is not appropriate for large
files or multiple small ones, as available memory can get exhausted.

Uploaded files should be renamed using only safe characters. [multer allows
you to provide a function to compute the file][3] name otherwise uploaded files
are given random names without file extension.

If uploaded file original metadata (e.g. original file location)  is required,
store it on another storage such as a database.

## Limit what users are allowed to upload

You should enforce what users are allowed to upload: if you're requesting, for
example, an avatar image, it does not make sense to allow users to upload
executable files. **DO NOT** rely on file extension to determine the file type.

The same way restrictions on file size should be applied otherwise big files
may exhaust available resources (memory and storage space), causing ia Denial
of Service.

[multer][2] allows you to do both passing simple configurations: see [limits][5]
and [fileFilter][6] configurations.

## DO NOT include or execute user uploaded contents

Only in really very special cases you will need to include or execute user
uploaded contents. If this is your case, do it on a sandboxed environment.

There are several projects with different features and security capabilities.
Below you find an incomplete list: you should see which best fits your needs

* [jailed][7] - Jailed is a small JavaScript library for running untrusted code
  in a sandbox. The library is written in vanilla-js and has no dependencies.
* [sandbox][8] - A nifty JavaScript sandbox for Node.js.
