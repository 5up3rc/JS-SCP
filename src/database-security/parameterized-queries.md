Parameterized Queries
=====================

Prepared Statements (with Parameterized Queries) are the best and most secure
way to protect against SQL Injections.

In some reported situations, prepared statements could harm performance of the
web application. Therefore, if for any reason you need to stop using this type
of database queries, we strongly suggest to read [Input Validation][1] and
[Output Encoding][2] sections.
