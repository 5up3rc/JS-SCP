Database Authentication
=======================

## Access the database with minimal privilege

If your JavaScript web application only needs to read data and doesn't need to
write information, create a database user whose permissions are `read-only`.

Always adjust the database user according to your web applications needs.

## Use a strong password

When creating your database access, choose a strong password. [OWASP Guidelines
for enforcing secure passwords][2] well defines what a strong password is.
You can use the [npm OWASP Password Strength Test module][3] to test your
password according these rules.

Some password managers do generate strong passwords as well as some online web
applications. Use them at your own risk.

## Remove default admin passwords

Most Database Management Systems have default accounts, most of them with no
password set on their highest privilege user accounts (e.g. MariaDB and MongoDB
use `root` with no password) what means that an attacker can gain access to
everything.

This should be fixed, setting a password or even better, creating a new account
with a non-default username with the same access rights.

Also, don't forget to remove your credentials and/or private key(s) if you're
going to post your code on a publicly accessible repository in GitHub.
