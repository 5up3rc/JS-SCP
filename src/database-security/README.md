Database Security
=================

This section on [OWASP Secure Coding Practices - Quick Reference guide][5]
covers database security issues and actions developers and database
administrators need to take when using databases in their web applications.

## The Best Practise

Before using a database with your JavaScript application, you should take care
of the following configurations:

* Secure database server installation[^1]
    * Change/set a password for `root` account(s)
    * Remove the `root` accounts that are accessible from outside the localhost
    * Remove any anonymous-user accounts
    * Remove any existing test database
* Remove any unnecessary stored procedures, utility packages,
  unnecessary services, vendor content (e.g. sample schemas)
* Install the minimum set of features and options required for your database to
  work with JavaScript
* Disable any default accounts which are not required to connect to the database
  of your web application

Also, because it's __important__ to validate input and encode output on the
database, be sure to take a look into the [Input Validation][1] and
[Output Encoding][2] sections of this guide.
