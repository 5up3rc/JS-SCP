Concurrency
===========

Shared resources bring concurrency problems such as [deadlocks][1] and
[resources starvation][2]. Techniques to solve these problems are already well-
known and documented: [semaphores][3] and [mutexes][4] are two of them.

This is an important topic which deserves to be covered here, because JavaScript
is known to be single threaded which takes advantage of its `Event Loop` for
performance. The point is that JavaScript concurrency model is exactly based on
its `Event Loop`.

You can read about JavaScript concurrency model in detail on [Mozilla Developer
NetworK "Concurrency model and Event Loop"][5].

The following few lines are meant just to remember you that your database is a
shared resource subject of concurrent connections and operations. Thankfully you
don't have to handle database concurrency, nevertheless when your application
performs read/write operations on the file system or even a single file you may
be subject of concurrency problems.

Let's walk through a common and simple example.
You have written a _middleware_ for [Express Node.js web application
framework][6] which counts visits, using a `counter.txt` file as storage.

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();
const file = path.resolve('./counter.txt');

const counterMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
    fs.readFile(file, (err, data) => {
        if (!err) {
            let counter = +data.toString();
            counter++;

            fs.writeFile(file, counter, (err) => {
                next();
            })
        }

        next();
    });
};
```

On every single request, the `counter.txt` file is read and written.

As you may know but certainly expect, the Express server answers multiple
requests at the same time and, for a busy web site, two different requests may
try to access the file at the same time[^1] or write operations do not happen in
the expected order messing with the counter.

This is where synchronization mechanisms and concurrency controls comes in.

You may want to have a look at one of these npm packages or other with the same
purpose, according to your needs:

* [rwlock][7]
* [semaphore][8]
* [mutexify][9]

Rule of thumbs, concurrency is something you should always care about because
when it comes to scalability the first approach will be to increase the number
of processes to handle a specific task.

[^1]: is is gonna happen more frequently if you have multiple processes attending HTTP requests
